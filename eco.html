        <h1>A Passion For Technology. A Passion For The Environment.</h1>
        <p>At Parcli, we know that manufacturing new technology and PC parts can have a high carbon footprint. Because of this, we incourage you to buy used parts and stop them from going to waste.</p>
        <h2>Old Tech Doesn't Need To Be Thrown Out</h2> 
        <p>Despite an old computer feeling slow and old, like it will never work properly again, this may not be the case. For example, one of our co-founders saved an old, slow laptop from going to the dump, and after a RAM upgrade and switching the software to chrome OS, as it runs better on old devices, the laptop worked fine.</p>
        <h3>Want Help Fixing an Old Device?</h3>
        <p>Email us at parclipcs@gmail.com<br>We can advise you on picking out RAM or storage upgrades, or help you find the solution to a problem.</p>
        <h2>We have many old and broken PC parts and we want to do something with them.</h2>
        <p>Any ideas? Email us.</p><br><br>
        <h4>Want to sell an old PC part or something that you don't use anymore that someone else could use or we could fix?</h4>
