        <p>Our co-founders Layth and Arthur decided to make this company as a way to have some fun and make money from it. Their idea was to create a company making great PCs listed at a fair price as so many are bad and overpriced. They also didn't want people to be limited by what the company sold and decided to let their customers get custom builds. They wanted to help people who didn't have time to build it themselves but if they are they can purchase parts for a fair price.</p>
        <p>You can email us at parclipcs@gmail.com</p>
